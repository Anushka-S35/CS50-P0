# CS50-P0
My CS50 Problem 0 project is a catch-the-stars game. The player moves a paddle to catch falling stars. Each caught star increases the score, while missed stars reduce lives. The game ends when lives reach 0, displaying a "Game Over" message. It features background music, sound effects, and polished transitions
